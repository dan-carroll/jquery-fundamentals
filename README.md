## Continuation of the Original Work

The content is now being maintained by the jQuery Project at the [learn.jquery.com repository](https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com). jQuery Fundamentals will be serving as the basis for the new [jQuery learning site](https://learn.jquery.com/) maintained by the jQuery project, and ongoing maintenance and support for this content will transfer to the jQuery project. 

The [jQuery Fundamentals website](http://jqfundamentals.com/) is designed to get you comfortable working through common problems you'll be called upon to solve using jQuery. This site is a replacement for the original [jQuery Fundamentals book](http://jqfundamentals.com/legacy/) which is also hosted here. The [code repository](https://github.com/bocoup/jqfundamentals.com) is available on GitHub.

## Introduction

My goal is to update a copy of the book to the latest version(s) of jQuery, which currently is 3.7 with version 4 on the horizon. Books on technical subjects need occasional updating, and as the two works cited above are more interactive works based on the original content, I would like to take this opportunity to bring this book up to date with newer versions of the jQuery library.

No claims are being made as to the fitness of this work for any purpose whatsoever. This work is meant to be an exercise in learning to work with the jQuery JavaScript library.

### [jQuery Learning Center](https://learn.jquery.com/)

> **Users**: There's a lot more to learn about building web sites and applications with jQuery than can fit in API documentation. If you're looking for explanations of the basics, workarounds for common problems, best practices, and how-tos, you're in the right place!

> **Authors**: Too much good information is spread across corners of the web, languishing in blog and forum posts, often just out of reach of people who need it, while the same questionable advice is duplicated across even more questionable sites. Help us stem the tide and educate today's — and tomorrow's — web developers.
